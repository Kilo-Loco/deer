# deer | A Project for the Bird Team

This is a simple project that is used to emulate the the Bird App. It was built using some of the same technologies that are used by the Bird iOS team, including:

* Swift
* Swinject
* ReactiveSwift
* Moya
* Cartography
* Core Data
* Slate

## Purpose of this Project

**deer** was made as an opportunity for me to brush up on my skills with Core Data and Moya, as well as an opportunity to learn new teachnologies like Swinject, ReactiveSwift, Cartography and Slate. It also serves as evidence that I am capable of creating an app with unfamiliar technologies, in a short amount of time.

## Video Overview of the App

If you're interested in getting a quick overview of what **deer** looks like or how it works, feel free to watch the video below.
